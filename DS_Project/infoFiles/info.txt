Note that for the F group, the reported solutions consider that 
the linehaul customer at (x, y) = (5103, 11065) demands 101 units,
and the L1 capacity is equal to 4400.


In the alternate instance version folder, we provide the F-group 
solutions considering that the linehaul customer at (x, y) = (5103, 11065) 
demands 1013 units, and the L1 capacity is equal to 4000.



Backhauls are the pick-ups
Linehauls are the deliveries


Parallel Method:
Start from the top of the savings (maximum saving) list and execute
the following.

If next edge has a common node with the existing route and the common node
is not an interior of the route then connet that edge to the existing route,
otherwise start a new route with next edge.

Repeat the above step until all nodes serviced or no edges left in sorted edges


Sequential Method:
This is same as parallel method except for one change. In sequential method
routes built sequentially. That is, we can not start new routes unitl
existing routes are filled.
